## Exercise:


### Load and clean the data
- Load nback_data.csv into a pandas read_csv().
- Ensure the following columns exist: subject_id, condition, response_time, is_correct, correct
- Drop rows with missing or impossible values (negative RT, RT > 10 s)
- Calculate the number of removed rows.
- Keep only response times between 0.2 and 3.0 seconds.

### Explore the data

- for each subject and condition, compute:
  - mean RT for correct trials
  - accuracy (proportion of correct trials)
  - d-prime (using hit rate and false alarm rate)
  - Compute mean/sd response time
  - Plot accuracy, RT distribution using seaborn.barplot, histplot, and distplot
  - Plot accuracy differences between conditions

- Bin response times into:
    - fast (RT < 0.5s)
    - medium (0.5–1.0s)
    - slow (>1.0s)
- Compute accuracy separately in each bin. What pattern do you observe?

### Simulate DDM

- Define a function: simulate_ddm(v, a, t0, s, n_trials=500)
    - drift rate v
    - boundary separation a
    - non-decision time t0
    - diffusion constant s (noise level)
    - returns simulated response times and correctness of the responses (1 or 0)

You can use Euler–Maruyama or a simple random-walk approximation:

```python
    import numpy as np
    def simulate_ddm(v, a, t0, s, n_trials=500):
        rts = []
        choices = []
        dt = 0.01  # time step
        for _ in range(n_trials):
            x = 0  # starting point
            time = 0
            while True:
                dx = v * dt + s * np.sqrt(dt) * np.random.randn()
                x += dx
                time += dt
                if x >= a:
                    rts.append(time + t0)
                    choices.append(1)  # upper boundary
                    break
                elif x <= 0:
                    rts.append(time + t0)
                    choices.append(0)  # lower boundary
                    break
        return np.array(rts), np.array(choices)
```

    - Simulate easy condition (high drift)
    - Simulate hard condition (low drift)
    - Simulate caution decision maker: Low caution: a = 0.7; Medium caution: a = 1.0; High caution: a = 1.6. Keep drift constant (v = 1.0).

    - How does accuracy change?
    - How does RT change?
    - Which is more sensitive: accuracy or RT?

- Explore the effect of noise: Simulate with (s). How does noise change RT/accuracy?
- How does non-decision time (t0) affect RT distribution?


For each condition in the real dataset:
- Compute empirical accuracy
- Compute empirical median RT
- Pick a drift rate that looks plausibly similar
- Simulate a DDM with that drift
- This is not parameter fitting yet, just intuition building.

Individual differences:
Pick one participant, and for that participant:
- Compute accuracy in easy & hard condition
- Estimate which parameter (drift vs boundary vs noise) is likely different
- Write a 4–5 sentence explanation.

- Explain:
 - How drift changes behavior
 - How boundary changes behavior
 - How noise changes behavior
 - Why non-decision time is essential
- What mismatch you observed between real and simulated data

Based on the following plot:

Is drift high or low?
Is caution high or low?
Does noise seem large?
Does it need a non-decision shift?


Grid search:
- Try drift values between 0.1 and 2.0 and find the one that best matches empirical accuracy.
- Find which boundary value makes simulated RT median most similar to observed RT median.
- Plot several random drift–diffusion paths for intuition.
