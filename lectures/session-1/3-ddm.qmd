## Problem

In cognitive science, many experiments present participants with simple choices (left or right, yes or no, same or different). These decisions produce two key behavioral measures:

- Accuracy (correct / incorrect)
- Response time (how long it took to respond)

However, raw behavioral data alone cannot explain why decisions were fast, slow, easy, or difficult. We need an explanatory model that links latent cognitive processes to the behavior we observe.

The Drift–Diffusion Model (DDM) describes decision making as a process of accumulating noisy evidence over time until a boundary is reached (to make a choice). The DDM has several key parameters that capture different aspects of the decision process:

- Drift rate: how quickly evidence accumulates (task difficulty, stimulus strength)
- Boundary separation: response caution or speed–accuracy tradeoff
- Noise: trial-to-trial variability
- Non-decision time: perceptual + motor delay

By simulating this dynamic process, the DDM can recreate the patterns seen in real behavior:

- Distributions of fast vs slow correct and error responses
- Accuracy differences across conditions
- Individual differences in decision strategies

## Data

- We will be using the example "nback_data.csv" dataset for this session.
- The data consists of the following columns:
    - subject_id: unique identifier for each participant
    - condition: experimental condition (e.g., easy for 2-back, hard for 3-back)
    - response_time: response time in seconds
    - is_correct: whether the response was correct (True) or incorrect (False)
    - correct: 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect
