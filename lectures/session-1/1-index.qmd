See [DDM](3-ddm.qmd) or [CLS](2-cls.qmd) for research problems that we will address using Python programming in this session.

## Why Python?

We are going to use Python for this course and for the data analysis because it is:

- free and open-source
- cross-platform
- widely used and well-supported
- well-documented
- enormous standard library
- extensive third-party libraries
- wide acceptance
- easy to read syntax
- many academic libs
- options to increase speed

- During the course, we are going to be using Google Colab; Login via (https://colab.google)

## Python Essentials

- python can be used as calculator; 2+3*5
- Integer Division: 5/2, 5//2, 5%2
- to do anything useful, we need to store the values. assign a value to a variable, So a variable is a name for a value. using =; weight = 55 OR height = 1.65
- b = a # assign the value of a to b
- b *= 2 is equivalent to b = b * 2
- multiple assignment; first, second = 'Bel', 'Val'
- Exercise: Swapping the contents of variables
- variable names rules: letters, digits, and underscores, cannot start with a digit, case sensitive; Weight vs weight; 0weight vs weight0; _weight vs weight
- Variables are created on demand whenever a value is assigned to them.
- %whos to see all variables in memory

### Basic Data Types

- strings; single quotes 'Hello, World!' OR double quotes "Hello, World!"
- multi-line strings; '''Hello, World!''' OR """Hello, World!"""
- fstrings; name = "Grace Hopper"; f"Hello, {name}!"
- new in 3.14: templates
- builtin functions; type(), round(), print(), help()
- Exercise Calculate BMI
- builtin functions for strings; len(), str(), int(), float(), list()
- Exercise Turn a String into a List, Reverse a String
- raw strings; r'C:\new_folder\test.txt'
- escape sequences; \n, \t, \', \", \\
- string methods; .upper(), .lower(), .strip(), .split(), .join(),
- unicode, template, and, fstrings,

- additional types: float, bool, int, None, complex

### Other Syntax Elements

- comments; # this is a comment
- builtin functions: print(), help(), dir(), abs(), round(), etc
- error messages

### Lists

- lists; [value1, value2, value3, ...]
- lists can contain any Python object, including other lists
- Use len(thing) to determine the length of something
- list indexing; list[index]
- negative indices; list[-1] is the last element
- list slicing; list[low:high]
- list methods; list.append(value), list.extend(another_list), list.insert(index, value

### Modules

- import libraryname to use a library in a program.; import time; print(time.ctime())
- import this

### Control Flow

- for loop, while loop
- enumerate, zip, range
- break, continue
- list comprehensions
- conditional statements
- switch-case statements via dictionary mapping
- new in 3.10: match-case statements
- if, elif, else, switch, case
- Use == to test for equality.
- pass (no-op)
- X and Y is only true if ...
- Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true.
- True and False represent truth values.

### Files

- Load the data into Google Colab; from google.colab import files; files.upload()
- files: open('filename', 'r') to open a file for reading
- files: open('filename', 'w') to open a file for writing
- files: file.read() to read the entire contents of a file
- files: file.readlines() to read a file line by line into a list
- Use glob.glob(pattern) to create a list of files whose names match a pattern. use * and ? as wildcards in the pattern.

### Pandas and Seaborn

- pandas for loading tabular data; pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

- pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
- Read a CSV file into a DataFrame; import pandas as pd; df = pd.read
- explore the DataFrame; df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()
- plotting with pandas; df.plot(), df.hist()
- pandas: grouping, filtering, masking, aggregating
- seaborn library for statistical data visualization
- import seaborn as sns; sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='column1', y='column2')


## Numpy

- numpy library for working with arrays
- arrays are like lists, but all elements must be of the same type
- array.shape to get the shape of an array
- array[x, y] to select a single element from a 2D array
- array slicing; array[low:high]
- Array indices start at 0, not 1 (0-indexed)
- array statistics; numpy.mean(array), numpy.amax(array), numpy.amin(array)
- axis argument for statistics; numpy.mean(array, axis=0) or numpy.mean(array, axis=1)
- stacking arrays
- Random number generation; numpy.random.normal, .random.rand, .random.choice
- seeds: np.random.seed(42)

- mutable vs immutable types; lists are mutable, strings and tuples are immutable


### Functions

- Define a function using def function_name(parameter)
- Call a function using function_name(value)
- variable scopes
- Variables created outside of any function are called global variables.
- Within a function, we can access global variables.
- Variables created within a function override global variables if their names match.
- Put docstrings in functions to provide help for that function.
- default values for function parameters
- Parameters matching by name, by position, or by defaults
- which parameters to put in the function definition, and which to leave out

### Error Handling

- errors/trackbacks, exception handling with try and except, raise, finally
-  assert statement to check for conditions that should always be true
- common errors: SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, KeyError
- defensive Program: errors are going to arise, detect them when expected
- Put assert to check the state of a program
- Use preconditions and postconditions to specify what a function expects

- TDD: Write tests before writing code


### Standard Libraries

- standard libraries
- math library: math.sqrt(), math.sin(), math.cos(), math.pi
- sys library: sys.argv, sys.stdin
- os library: os.path, os.listdir(), os.mkdir(), os.remove()


- magics: %%time,  %lsmagic, %script


### RegEx

- regex


### Version Control

- using colab and google drive
- using github
